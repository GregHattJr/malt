title: Malt Demo Site
---

Malt is a static website generator built in Python. It transforms a directory
of text files into a WordPress-style website with support for pages, posts,
and custom post types.

You're currently viewing a demonstration site filled with sample content.
Here's a list of sample pages to check out:

* [HTML Elements](@root/elements//)
* [Images](@root/images//)
* [Code](@root/code//)
* [Short](@root/short//)

Malt supports blog-style posts as well as pages. Here's a bunch of
sample posts:

* [Posts](@root/posts/index//)
    * [England](@root/posts/england/index//)
    * [Ireland](@root/posts/ireland/index//)
    * [Scotland](@root/posts/scotland/index//)
    * [Wales](@root/posts/wales/index//)

Pages and posts are Malt's two default *record types*, but you can add as many
custom types to your site as you like. Let's use a custom type to devote a
section of our site to our friends, the animals:

* [Animals](@root/animals/index//)

Custom types can have their own directory indexes, tag indexes, templates,
and styling.
