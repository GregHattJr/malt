title: Themes
---

A theme is a collection of templates, styles, and scripts that together provide the look and feel for a site. Themes should be placed in the site's `lib` folder, and the name of the active theme directory specified in the `config.py` file.

::: python

    theme = "phoenix"

Ark ships with two bundled themes: `phoenix`, the default theme, and `debug`, a diagnostic tool useful when designing themes or debugging sites.

Note that you can override the currently active theme with the `build` command's `--theme` flag:

    $ ark build --theme debug

Ark searches for a named theme first in the site's theme library, then (if it exists) in the global theme library specified by the `$ARK_THEMES` environment variable. Finally it searches among the default themes bundled with Ark itself.



## Theme Structure

A theme directory should contain two subdirectories, `resources` and `templates`. The content of the `resources` directory is copied directly to the site's output directory during building. The `templates` directory is where Ark looks for the theme's template files.

Ark has builtin support for templates written in [Jinja][] (using a `.jinja` extension) and [Ibis][] (using a `.ibis` extension). Support for other template languages can be added via plugins.

## Template Files

When Ark generates a HTML page it searches for the appropriate template file in the following order, where `<type>` indicates the record type in question, e.g. `posts`:

*Single Record page*

    1) <type>-single
    2) single

*Directory index page*

    1) <type>-dir-index
    2) dir-index
    3) index

*Tag index page*

    1) <type>-tag-index
    2) tag-index
    3) index

A record can specify a custom template file to use in its header:

    ---
    template: my-custom-template
    ---

Note that the file extension should be omitted from the template name.
